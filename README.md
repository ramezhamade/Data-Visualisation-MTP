# Introduction
Labour markets, as any other social formations, exhibit stratification. This means workers (sharply) differ in terms of salary. Stratification can originate from several sources: ethnicity, religious beliefs, age, and gender. By analyzing a real-world datasets comprising firm-level data, you will contribute to inform the formulation of economic, organizational, and social policies that tackle on the problem of stratification in labour markets.

# Context for the case study
According to the prior literature and empirical evidence, gender pay gap produces negative consequences at several levels of analysis. 

For example:
- female workers expect lower returns from their investment in human capital â€“ hence, the levels of education we observe in the population of female workers is sub-optimal (that is, lower than what expected should female workers chose their investment in education on the basis of their cognitive skills and aspirations only) gender pay gap can generate intra-personal conflict in the workplace, which negatively affects the quality of organizational communication, coordination, and performance because of attrition, gender pay gap correlates with involuntary turnover (i.e., workers quit their job) Prior studies have investigated the feasibility and impact of some policies that target the problem of gender stratification. An example is the so-called gender quota policy, which has already started to produce tangible effects. Yet, there is substantial room to improve the quality of extant and future policies.

# Problem to address
Extant policies are 'general' in nature as they apply equally to firms. Since gender stratification is a cultural byproduct, the policies that are supposed to contrast gender pay gap could be more effective if properly tuned to fit the cultural aspects that prevail in certain industries and/or places.
